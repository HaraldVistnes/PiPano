""" Module for reading values from a photocell 

    This implementation is based on the tutorial
    http://learn.adafruit.com/basic-resistor-sensor-reading-on-raspberry-pi/basic-photocell-reading

    Uses RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit for reading the photocell
    value as the Raspberry PI does not have any analog pins.

    As the photocell behaves as a resistor that changes resistance
    based on the amount of incoming light, the time to charge 
    the capacitor will depend on the amount of light.

    The function RCtime returns the number of loops required to 
    charge the capacitor enough for the input pin to go from 
    low to high.

    The more light, the lower the resistance and the lower number
    returned from RCtime.

    RCtime - low value means more light than a higher value
